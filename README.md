# Deploy a financial microservice using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) on Linux on Z 

In this lab, you will learn how a traditional z/OS banking transaction can be modernized and transformed into services (APIs) that can be assessed by a hybrid cloud web application.   This application will be deployed using OCP tools and the workload will run on the OCP cluster residing on System Z Linux.

You will perform the following tasks:

1. Use the IBM API Portal to subscribe and connect to the set of z/OS banking services for this lab. 
2. Use your workstation to access your github repository containing the web application locally.  Update the source code with the appropriate credentials required to access the z/OS banking services.  Use node.js to build and test the web application. 
3. Use the OCP web console to build and deploy the the web application from github.

# Architecture

This lab accesses a fictitious retail banking system called MPLbank. MPLbank integrates an Account Management System running on IBM Mainframe. On top of this component, an API layer based on z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition and IBM API Connect has been set up to deliver banking APIs. It makes banking services reachable through APIs from all kind of applications. 

<kbd>![alt text](images/Arch-banking-app-lab.png "Architecture")</kbd>

1. The user deploys a Docker image (banking application based microservice) to the OCP.  
2. The user configures and runs a container based on this Docker image. Once started, the application calls banking APIs published in API Connect.
3. API Connect calls the back-end Z Mainframe through a banking API published in z/OS Connect EE.
4. z/OS Connect EE calls the Account Management System (AMS) running in CICS. A COBOL program processes the request and returns banking data. Finally, banking data are sent back to the microservice application.

# Step 1 - Discover and run the banking application locally

## Part 1 - Discover the banking application

1. Locate your assigned ID number: ________________.

2. Locate your assigned git repository: _______________________________.

3. Launch a terminal (or command prompt in Windows).

4. Clone your git repository to create a local copy of your banking application.  Replace xx with your assigned ID number.

   `git clone https://github.com/zcloud-01/banking-app-xx`
    
5. Examine the directory structure of your imported repository.

   `cd banking-app-xx`
   
   `ls (or dir for Windows)`
   
   * **app.js** - Application server code
   * **public/index.html** - Application client code (banking dashboard)
   * **public/css** - Application stylesheet
   * **public/js** - JavaScript libraries 
   * **public/js/bankingAPI.js** - Source code that connects to a core banking system through API calls. You will modify this file later. 
   * **package.json** - Package dependencies file
   * **Dockerfile** - File to build the Docker image 

## Part 2 - Subscribe to the banking API through the API Developer Portal

1. Locate your assigned API Developer Portal account and password. 

2. Start a web browser.

3. Go to the API Developer Portal, https://developer-contest-spbodieusibmcom-prod.developer.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/

3. Make a note of the following.  For Windows, you can copy this information to notepad or sticky notes, for example. You will need this information later to access the API.
	
   * **client ID** 
   * **client Secret** 
	
   <kbd>![alt text](images/keyApplication.png "API Keys")</kbd>

4. Before working with the banking API, you need to subscribe to it first. Display the list of available API products.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/bankingProduct.png "Choose the default plan")</kbd>
	
   * Click **API Products** from the top menu.
   * Click **Banking Product** in the list.

5. Subscribe to the Banking API.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/APISubscription.png "Subscribe")</kbd>
	
   * Click **Subscribe** to subscribe to the *Default Plan*.
	
   <kbd>![alt text](images/APISubscription2.png "Banking Product")</kbd>
	
   * Select the App that you have just created, **myappxx**.
	
   * Click **Subscribe**.
   
5. Log out of the API Developer Portal.	
	
6. Return to the workstation terminal (or Command prompt)

7. Modify the *banking-app-xx/public/js/bankingAPI.js* file. You can use notepad, for example.

   * Replace **YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE** with your client ID value from the IBM API developer portal.
   
   * Replace **YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE** with your client Secret value from the IBM API developer portal.

# Step 2 - Build and deploy the banking application with OCP

When using OpenShift there are a number of different ways you can add an application. We will use the method to Build and deploy from source code contained in a Git repository from a Dockerfile. 

## Part 1 - Build and deploy a docker imager from GitHub  

1. Locate your assigned OCP portal user and password.

1. Login to the OCP portal with your assigned user and password.

   * From a web browser, enter the URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.linuxone.io.
   
2. At the login screen, select **ldapidp**.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-login1.png)</kbd>

3. Enter your assigned username and password.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-login2.png)</kbd>

4. (If necessary) Select the Developer perspective for the project instead of the Adminstrator perspective 
  
   * Select **Developer** in the left hand side menu. 

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-login3.png)</kbd>

5. Create a project.

   * Click on **Project** and **Create Project**

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-project1.png)</kbd>

   * Enter the name of the project: **projectxx**.  
    
    *Important:  You must use this exact name with your assigned user number in the project name.*
    
   * Click on **Create**
   
   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-project2.png)</kbd>

   As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.

6. Import your Dockerfile from your git repository to be built and deployed.

   * Click the **From Dockerfile** tile.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-deploy1.png)</<kbd>

7. Enter your git repo URL. 

   * **https://github.com/zcloud-01/banking-app-xx.git**

8. Change the Container Port to **3000**.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-deploy2.png)</kbd>

   From the name of the repo, the Application Name and deployment Name fields will be automatically populated. The deployment name is used in OpenShift to identify the resources created when the application is deployed. This will include the internal Service name used by other applications in the same project to communicate with it, as well as being used as part of the default hostname for the application when exposed externally to the cluster via a Route. The Application Name field is used to group multiple deployments together under the same name as part of one overall application.

   At the bottom of this page you will see that the checkbox for creating a route to the application is selected. This indicates that the application will be automatically given a public URL for accessing it.

9. Click on **Create**.

   This will return you to the Topology view, but this time you will see a representation of the deployment, rather than the options for deploying an application.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-deploy3.png)</kbd>

   You may see the colour of the ring in the visualisation change from white, to light blue and then blue. This represents the phases of deployment as the container for the application starts up.

   When the deployment is complete, you will see a green check mark indicating that the deployment was successful. 

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-deploy5.png)</kbd>

10.Access the application.

   You can access the application via its public URL, by clicking on the URL shortcut icon on the visualisation of the deployment.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/ocp-deploy6.png)</kbd>

11.Test your application.

   <kbd>![alt text](images/linux1CC-banking-app-test.png "Banking application")</kbd>
	
   * Select a customer ID.
   * The application requests banking data from IBM Z through API Connect and z/OS Connect EE.
   * The result is displayed in a JSON structure.

:thumbsup: Congratulations! You have suucessfully deployed your banking application to run on the OCP cluster on System Z Linux server.
