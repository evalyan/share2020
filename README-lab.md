# Deploy a financial microservice using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) on Linux on Z 

In this lab, you will experience how a traditional z/OS transaction can be modernized by creating services (APIs) that can be assessed by a hybrid cloud banking application.   This web application will be deployed using OpenShift and the workload runs on OCP cluster on System Z Linux.

You will perform the following tasks:

* Use the IBM API Portal to connect to a set of z/OS banking services. 
* Modify a web application to access the z/OS banking services. 
* Use node.js to build and test the web application on your laptop. 
* Build, deploy, and test the web application on OCP.
* Use OCP to modify the web application and redeploy the changes.

# Architecture

This lab accesses a fictitious retail banking system called MPLbank. MPLbank integrates an Account Management System running on IBM Mainframe. On top of this component, an API layer based on z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition and IBM API Connect has been set up to deliver banking APIs. It makes banking services reachable through APIs from all kind of applications. 

![alt text](images/Arch-banking-app-lab.png "Architecture")

1. The user deploys a Docker image (banking application based microservice) to the OCP.  
2. The user configures and runs a container based on this Docker image. Once started, the application calls banking APIs published in API Connect.
3. API Connect calls the back-end Z Mainframe through a banking API published in z/OS Connect EE.
4. z/OS Connect EE calls the Account Management System (AMS) running in CICS. A COBOL program processes the request and returns banking data. Finally, banking data are sent back to the microservice application.

# Step 1 - Discover and run the banking application locally

## Part 1 - Discover the banking application

1. Launch a terminal and clone your GitHub repository *banking-app-xx* to create a local copy of your banking application, where xx is your assigned ID number:

   `git clone https://github.com/zcloud-01/banking-app-xx`
    
2. Take a look at the imported *banking-app-xx* folder:

   `cd banking-app-xx`
   
   `dir or ls`
   
	* *app.js*: the application server code.
	* *public/index.html*: the application client code (banking dashboard).
	* *public/css*: the application stylesheet.
	* *public/js*: the JavaScript libraries. 
	* *public/js/bankingAPI.js* will be modified later to connect to a corebanking system through API calls.
	* *package.json*: the package dependencies file.
	* *Dockerfile*: file to build the Docker image. 

## Part 2 - Subscribe to the banking API through the API Developer Portal

# Step 2 - Build and deploy a Docker image to OCP

When using OpenShift there are a number of different ways you can add an application. We will use the method to Build and deploy from source code contained in a Git repository from a Dockerfile. 

1. Login to the OCP portal.

   From a web browser, enter the URL: https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.linuxone.io.
   
2. At the login screen, select **ldapidp**.

![alt text](images/ocp-login1.png)

3. Enter your assigned username and password.

![alt text](images/ocp-login2.png)

3. Create a project.

   * Click on **Project** and **Create Project**

![alt text](images/ocp-project1.png)

   * Enter project name: **projectxx**.  *Important:  You must use this exact name with your assigned user number in the project name*
   * Click on **Create**
   
![alt text](images/ocp-project2.png)

As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.

4. Import your Dockerfile from your git repository to be built and deployed.

   * Click the **From Dockerfile** tile.

![alt text](images/ocp-deploy1.png)

6. Enter your git repo URL. 

   * **https://github.com/zcloud-01/banking-app-xx.git**

7. Change the Container Port to **3000**.

![alt text](images/ocp-deploy2.png)

From the name of the repo, the Application Name and deployment Name fields will be automatically populated.
The deployment name is used in OpenShift to identify the resources created when the application is deployed. This will include the internal Service name used by other applications in the same project to communicate with it, as well as being used as part of the default hostname for the application when exposed externally to the cluster via a Route.
The Application Name field is used to group multiple deployments together under the same name as part of one overall application.

At the bottom of this page you will see that the checkbox for creating a route to the application is selected. This indicates that the application will be automatically given a public URL for accessing it.

8. Click on **Create**.

This will return you to the Topology view, but this time you will see a representation of the deployment, rather than the options for deploying an application.

![alt text](images/ocp-deploy3.png)

You may see the colour of the ring in the visualisation change from white, to light blue and then blue. This represents the phases of deployment as the container for the application starts up.

When the deployment complent, you will see a green check mark indicating that the deployment was successful. 

![alt text](images/ocp-deploy5.png)

9. Access the application.

You can access the application via its public URL, by clicking on the URL shortcut icon on the visualisation of the deployment.

![alt text](images/ocp-deploy6.png)

 
10. Test your application.

![alt text](images/linux1CC-banking-app-test.png "Banking application")
	
    * Select a customer ID.
    * Please wait while the application calls banking data from the Mainframe through API Connect and z/OS Connect EE.
    * The result is displayed in a JSON structure.


:thumbsup: Congratulations! You have suucessfully deployed your banking application to run on the OCP cluster on System Z Linux server.
